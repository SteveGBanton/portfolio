# Steve Banton's portfolio

Built primarily with React / Redux. Portfolio items can be added to the initial state object and they will automatically be featured on the 'work' page, where they can be sorted by tag. There is not yet a backend where projects can be added.

Also features a d3.js force directed graph to display connected social icons (It manipulates the DOM directly, but there are no issues with such a small project).

Feel free to adapt the code as you see fit!
